# Predicting Turnover using Employeee Data
Employee Turnover Model [In-Progress]

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting when members of a group are likely to leave, enabling strategies to enhance retention and proactively manage recruitment efforts. By employing a systematic, step-by-step approach, the methodology used here can be applied to various machine learning challenges. This initiative is part of the broader field of Group Analytics, Membership Analytics, but this application is specifically for the People Analytics & HR domain.

## Research Objective
The main outcome of this project is to predict the probability of an employee leaving. We target a probability value because the response variable (employment) is binary: TRUE for active employee and FALSE for inactive employee.

## Data Description
The dataset contains employee data for 1,470 employees with demographic, performance, and employment data (gender, race, income, employee engagement surveys, tenure, ...) sourced from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. Analysis of the data used can be found in the EDA.ipynb file.
